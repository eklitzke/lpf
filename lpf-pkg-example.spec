#
# Example lpf-package spec file
#
# This example is for a hypothetic package containing a
# non-redistributable font called called restricted-fonts.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The target package spec file i. e., restricted-fonts.spec.
# - If the target package needs user to confirm some eula-kind
#   terms the file with these terms, here called eula.txt
# - Any sources or patches the target package uses which does not
#   have a download link in their Source: or Patch: tags (i. e.,
#   any source or patch which spectool -g can't download).

# %%global will not work here, lazy evaluation needed.
%define         target_pkg %(t=%{name}; echo ${t#lpf-})

# The lpf package has the name lpf-<target-package>.spec:
Name:           lpf-restricted-fonts
# The lpf package version-release must be the same as the target package:
Version:        2.2
Release:        1%{?dist}
Summary:        Bootstrap package building restricted-fonts using lpf

# The license and url of the lpf package are basically void:
License:        MIT
URL:            https://github.com/leamas/lpf
Group:          Development/Tools
# The arch should reflect the target package architecture. A font
# package is noarch. For binary stuff, typically only i386 and
# perhaps also x86_64 use ExclusiveArch: %{ix86} x86_64.
BuildArch:      noarch
# The target package spec:
Source0:        restricted-fonts.spec.in
# The terms user needs to accept before building package.
Source1:        eula.txt
# Add sources and patches used by target spec which can't
# be downloaded:
Source2:        restricted-fonts-fontconfig.conf
Source3:	README
